fluffy experiments from http://a-b-z.co/

1. *PaperPyramidModule* draws a folded pyramid in plan view. You can change the sizes of the base (W and S keys) and height (A and D keys). ESC to quit.

2. *PaperPyramids3D* is a sinuous grid of pyramids in 3D. I might use this to inspire a paper sculpture made of these pyramidal units.
